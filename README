Bezier surface fitting with automatic order selection (BezBic) from position data

Description
-----------

This Matlab library provides tools for surface fitting from position data. There are three main steps in this process: 1, an occupancy map is constructed from a history of position data; 2, local point selection identifies a small point cloud for surface fitting; 3, a Bezier surface is fit to the point cloud. Surface order is determined automatically using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).


Usage
-----

Usage examples are scripts with the prefix "demo_". In particular, "demo_paper" were used to generate plots and tables for the paper.

The occupancy map is maintained using the VolumeAccumulator class which has a VolumeDiscretization object.

The function pointselection identifies boundary voxels from a dense binary matrix.

The function fitsurface fits a Bezier surface to a point cloud and automatically determines the surface order.
